# Conventions

In order to match our coding style, make sure you:
 - adhere to the editorconfig; common IDE's have support natively or through addons.
 - adhere to PSR-2.
 - Do not use any helper functions except for `app()` and `resolve()`.
 
# Repository branches

In order to keep track of local branches, we use the following format:

```
<initials>/<issueId>-<short description>
```

So for instance:
```
dk/483-drop-customer
```

Feel free to drop the issueId reference for smaller tasks/commits.
